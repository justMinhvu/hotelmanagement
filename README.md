It seems like you're encountering an error message related to Spotify's API. The specific error code is 429, which indicates a "Too Many Requests" error. This means that you've exceeded the rate limit for making requests to the Spotify API. The message also mentions that the maximum number of retries has been reached, so you won't be able to retry the request immediately.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to wait for some time before making further requests to the Spotify API. The exact amount of time you'll need to wait will depend on the specific rate limit that you've exceeded. You can find more information about Spotify's API rate limits in their documentation.

Here are some additional tips for avoiding rate limit errors:

* Use batching to make multiple requests in a single call.
* Cache responses to avoid making unnecessary requests.
* Use exponential backoff to retry failed requests.

I hope this helps!
